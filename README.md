The benchmarking script used for [jsPerf](http://jsperf.com/), `benchmark.js`, is a heavily modified version of the excellent [JSLitmus](http://broofa.com/Tools/JSLitmus/) by Robert Kieffer. It uses adaptive test cycles, meaning every test will roughly take the same amount of time, regardless of the operation. Thanks to this awesome feature, jsPerf tests can be run in any browser, on any device — including smartphones. A lot has changed between JSLitmus and `benchmark.js`. Feel free to fork if you see possible improvements!
